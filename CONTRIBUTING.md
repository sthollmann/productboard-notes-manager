# Contributing to Productboard Notes Manager

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Productboard Notes Manager! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Process

We follow a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach:

1. **Write Tests First** - Always write tests before implementing functionality
2. **Red-Green-Refactor** - Write failing tests, make them pass, then refactor
3. **Maintain Coverage** - Ensure all new code meets the 80%+ coverage thresholds
4. **Test Edge Cases** - Include error handling, boundary conditions, and failure scenarios

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Productboard API token (for testing)

### Local Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/productboard-notes-manager.git
   cd productboard-notes-manager
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your Productboard API token
   ```

5. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix
- Use descriptive branch names:
  - `feature/add-note-filtering`
  - `bugfix/fix-rollback-issue`
  - `docs/update-api-documentation`

### Code Style

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing Requirements

**All contributions must include tests!**

1. **Write tests first** for any new functionality
2. **Ensure all tests pass**: `npm test`
3. **Maintain coverage**: `npm run test:coverage`
4. **Test edge cases**: Error conditions, boundary values, invalid inputs

#### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Statements**: 80% minimum
- **Functions**: 80% minimum
- **Lines**: 80% minimum
- **Branches**: 50% minimum

#### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });

  it('should do something specific', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'test data';
    
    // Act
    const result = await functionUnderTest(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected output');
  });
});
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`

6. **Update documentation** if needed
7. **Commit your changes** with clear messages
8. **Push to your fork**
9. **Create a pull request**

## Development Guidelines

### API Changes

- **Backward compatibility**: Avoid breaking existing API endpoints
- **Versioning**: Use API versioning for major changes
- **Documentation**: Update API documentation for any changes

### Database/Storage Changes

- **Migration strategy**: Provide migration path for existing data
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure old data formats are supported
- **Testing**: Test with existing data structures

### Security Considerations

- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Maintain secure authentication patterns
- **API keys**: Never commit API keys or sensitive data
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated
