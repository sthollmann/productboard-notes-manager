## How to Run Tests

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests for CI/CD
npm run test:ci
```

### Automated Testing
- GitHub Actions workflow configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Tests run on every push to main/develop branches
- Tests run on all pull requests
- Coverage reports generated and uploaded to Codecov

## Test Quality
- **Comprehensive**: Tests cover all major functionality
- **Isolated**: Each test runs independently
- **Reliable**: All tests pass consistently
- **Fast**: Full test suite completes in under 1 second
- **Maintainable**: Clear test structure and descriptive names

## Coverage Thresholds
- Statements: 80% (achieved: 90.69%)
- Functions: 80% (achieved: 81.81%)
- Lines: 80% (achieved: 90.47%)
- Branches: 50% (achieved: 57.89%)

## Key Testing Features
1. **API Mocking**: All external API calls are mocked using Nock
2. **Error Simulation**: Tests simulate various error conditions
3. **State Management**: Tests verify local changes are tracked correctly
4. **Rollback Testing**: Complete rollback functionality is tested
5. **Authentication**: API authentication headers are verified
6. **Network Resilience**: Network error handling is tested

## Continuous Integration
The project includes a complete CI/CD pipeline:
- Automated testing on multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)
- Coverage reporting
- Test result archiving
- PR comments with coverage reports
- Fail-fast on coverage threshold violations

## Future Improvements
- Add performance tests
- Add security tests
- Add browser-based end-to-end tests
- Increase branch coverage to 80%+
